Overview of Data Analysis Notebooks

This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the Weather & Solar Dashboard project, each focused on a particular aspect of data analysis. These notebooks provide a step-by-step approach to analyzing and cleaning weather and solar data, offering insights into different variables and their relationships.

List of Notebooks:

Correlation_analysis.ipynb: Examines the relationships between various weather and solar parameters. It provides an understanding of how different variables are correlated and interact with each other.

Data_cleaning.ipynb: Focuses on preparing raw data for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing outliers to ensure data quality.

Data_quality_check.ipynb: Conducts a thorough examination of the data to check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset's integrity.

Histograms_and_bubble_chart.ipynb: Visualizes data distributions and inter-variable relationships through histograms and bubble charts, helping to explore trends and correlations within the dataset.

Summary_statistics.ipynb: Summarizes key statistical measures for various variables, including the mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles, providing a comprehensive overview of the data.

Time_series_analysis.ipynb: Investigates the trends and patterns of variables over time. This analysis helps in identifying seasonality and temporal changes in the data.

Wind_and_temp_analysis.ipynb: Analyzes wind speed, direction, and temperature data, focusing on wind patterns and temperature variations to uncover important weather insights.

Each notebook is designed with clear explanations and code to perform the respective analysis. Together, they offer a valuable toolkit for exploring and understanding the weather and solar data, contributing to the development of the dashboard.
